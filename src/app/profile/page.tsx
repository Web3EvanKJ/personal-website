      <p className="mb-4">
        Hi! I’m Evan, a dedicated and curious full-stack web developer who
        thrives on turning ideas into seamless, interactive, and reliable
        digital experiences. While I love crafting clean and responsive
        interfaces with <span className="font-semibold">Next.js</span> and{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">Tailwind CSS</span>, I’m equally
        passionate about building solid backend systems that power them.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        My journey into coding began out of curiosity, tinkering with small
        scripts and basic websites. That curiosity soon grew into a deep passion
        for solving real-world problems through code. Over time, I’ve expanded
        my skills beyond the frontend — working with{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">Node.js</span>,{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">Express</span>, and{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">RESTful APIs</span> to create scalable,
        maintainable backend services. I also enjoy working with databases like{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">PostgreSQL</span> and{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">MongoDB</span>, ensuring that
        applications are not only fast on the surface but also efficient under
        the hood.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        I believe that great web experiences are built on a foundation of
        well-structured architecture, clean code, and strong communication
        between frontend and backend. Whether it’s optimizing API performance,
        securing endpoints, or integrating third-party services, I’m driven by
        the challenge of making systems more robust and reliable.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Beyond development, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies like
        serverless computing, edge functions, and blockchain-based solutions. I
        contribute to open-source projects, share knowledge with the community,
        and collaborate with other developers to bring ambitious ideas to life.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I’m away from my desk, you might find me playing games, enjoying
        music, or sipping coffee while brainstorming my next big project ☕.
